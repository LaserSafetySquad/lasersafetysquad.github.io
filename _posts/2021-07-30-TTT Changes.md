Note that this post assumes you have nothing (no Gmod, CS:S). If you have already played TTT before, please see the "Upgrading to TTT2" section.

Also note that this guide (like every other one that will be written on this site) assumes the reader is a fucking idiot. Don't be offended if you aren't a fucking idiot. There are several fucking idiots in this group who know less about computers than my grandmother (which is the whole reason I set this shit up in the first place; It's a pain in the ass to have to explain to eight different people how to do one thing at eight different levels when I just want to play fucking Gmod).

# What you will need

To play TTT with us, there's a few things you'll need first.

## REQUIRED
- [Radmin VPN](/guides/Radmin-VPN.html)
- [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/)
- And either...
    - [Counter Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/)
    - Counter Strike: Source content (will be covered later)

## OPTIONAL (may improve your experience)

- [Half-Life 2: Episode 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/380/HalfLife_2_Episode_One/)
- [Half-Life 2: Episode 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420/HalfLife_2_Episode_Two/)

As stated, the optional items aren't *necessary* but some maps and weapons might work better with them. Ultimately, everything here is worth buying at some point but don't sweat it if you don't wanna pay for the optional stuff. They goes on sale often and you may want to buy them then (they're worth playing).

Once you've sorted all of that, you'll need to subscribe to all the addons that we use. You can do so by pressing "Subscribe to All" on the [Workshop Collection](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960290210) (this link opens the page on Steam and your browser may ask if you want to do that). Note that this collection is updated often so you may want to Favorite it or otherwise keep it handy.

# Creating a preset 

Presets allow you to easily disable and enable large amounts of addons quickly. This is very useful for playing other gamemodes.

1. Open Gmod and go to "Addons" on the main menu.
2. In the bottom right of the panel, open the addon settings.
3. Press "Create Preset".
4. Give it a name, like "TTT preset".
5. Make sure that...
    - Both "Save currently enabled addons" and "Save currently disabled addons" are ticked.
    - "What to do with addons not in the preset?" is set to "Set Disabled".
6. Press "Create Preset".

And you're set.

# Getting CS:S content

It is possible to get the required CS:S content without, well, paying for it. It isn't very hard but it can be risky to find and download it (as in: you may get some malware depending on where you get your files from). It's also possible that you may not get the full experience that you would get from buying CS:S. I would advise that you buy CS:S when it goes on sale (which it does [pretty often](https://steamdb.info/app/240/) and for very cheap, usually $1.99 or $0.99).

# Joining the game

As stated in the Radmin VPN guide, most of the time you should be provided with the IP or will be able to get it from Radmin. Just ask if you need this info.

At this point, if you started from scratch, you're done! If you need to upgrade to TTT2, continue on.

# Upgrading to TTT2

We (Matt and myself) recently tested out TTT2 and decided that it is a really good upgrade to TTT from both a player and server admin perspective. Believe me when I say it really had to be good to warrant the effort of getting everyone to switch over. In general it just works better and is much less of a headache from the server management side.

There are two main avenues you can use to upgrade your game. You shouldn't (hopefully) ever have to do something like this again.

## IF YOU DON'T HAVE PERSONAL ADDONS

If you *don't* have any addons that you care about losing, this method is for you.

1. Go to the [Garry's Mod workshop](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop/).
2. On the right panel under "Your Files" click on "Subscribed items".
3. On the right panel press "Unsubscribe From All"
4. Go to the [Workshop Collection](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960290210) and press "Subscribe to All".

If you do this method, it is a good idea to create a preset of these addons so that you can load and unload them later if you want to play another gamemode. To do this, scroll up to the "Creating a Preset" section.

## IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL ADDONS

If you have personal addons, you'll need to unsubscribe from the following addons (which were removed due to general bugginess or from incompatibility with TTT2). Note that most of these addons have been replaced with updated versions:

- [Killer Notifier](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=167547072)
- [Town of Terror](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092556189)
- [Weapon Stats](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=300375321)
- [The Penetrator](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=952516754)
- [Death Faker](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308966836)
- [Defibrillator](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801433502)
- [Advanced Disguiser](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=606792331)
- [Door Locker](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=290945941)

You should also consider creating a preset for TTT if you haven't, but it might take a minute if you have lots of non-TTT addons.

# Changing back to the old HUD

I personally like the old TTT HUD more than the new TTT2 one. Luckily, it's very easy to switch back.

1. Press F1 in-game.
2. Go to "Appearance"
3. Go to "HUD Switcher"

Note that much of the interface is customizable, and you can also download your own custom HUD from the workshop (just make sure it's compatible with TTT2 and not regular TTT).
