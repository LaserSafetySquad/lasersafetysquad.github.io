I"◊<p>Note that this post assumes you are starting from scratch. If you have already played Arma before, please see the ‚ÄúUpdating Mods‚Äù section.</p>

<p>Also note that this guide (like every other one that will be written on this site) assumes the reader is a fucking idiot. Don‚Äôt be offended if you aren‚Äôt a fucking idiot. There are several fucking idiots in this group who know less about computers than a brick wall (which is the whole reason I set this shit up in the first place; It‚Äôs a pain in the ass to have to explain to eight different people how to do one thing at eight different levels when I just want to play fucking Gmod).</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

<p>Assuming you know you‚Äôll need Arma itself, there are a few programs you‚Äôll need to play with us.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/guides/Radmin-VPN.html">Radmin VPN</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/">Teamspeak 3</a></li>
</ol>

<p>We use Teamspeak for the Task Force Radio mod which allows positional VOIP and usage of radios in-game. It is damn near essential in order to keep communications organized (having 7+ people in a voice call gets hectic quickly).</p>

<h2 id="should-i-buy-the-arma-3-dlc">‚ÄúShould I buy the Arma 3 DLC?‚Äù</h2>

<p>None of the Arma 3 DLC is required. If the Apex DLC is on sale you may want to buy it solely for the map but most of the content that we use (and will likely ever use) is from mods. The only time you may be hindered by this is if you try to take DLC gear off of a fellow player.</p>

<h1 id="installing-mods">Installing Mods</h1>

<p>Arma, like Gmod, is a sandbox game with a lot of mods. Keep in mind that these mods take up a fair amount of space (20+ GB). There are two main modlists for you to pick from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfOXMC5HI_uBKMZHiddpR0lDZjVl1qi2/view?usp=sharing">LSS Arma Modlist</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NHRaGLSqM4htmI8onP4g0T6yTC1on2af/view?usp=sharing">LSS Arma Modlist (JSRS)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The JSRS version of the modlist contains the JSRS Soundmod which greatly improves the game sound quality. It is optional, does not affect gameplay or performance, and is ~1.4 GB.</p>

<p>When you open the page, go to the top right and press the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button. Installing the modlist is as simple as dragging the modlist onto the launcher window. If the launcher asks if you would like to subscribe to items, say yes.</p>

<p>When you get the mods downloaded, make sure they are all enabled.</p>

<h1 id="learning-to-play">Learning to play</h1>

<p>Arma is a complex game. It is meant to be a simulator and thus has uncommon game mechanics and a billion keybinds. So please, for the love of all that is holy, play through the ‚ÄúBootcamp‚Äù campaign before you come to play with us. It‚Äôll take you an hour or two but it will teach you the basics of movement, combat, and equipment usage. You don‚Äôt have to play through the whole thing but it will really help you when you start. Note that when you play the campaign that you should launch the game without any mods enabled (which can be done by clicking the arrow next to the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button and pressing ‚ÄúPlay without mods and optional DLC‚Äù).</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt show up to an operation not knowing how to play.</p>

<p>Even after playing through the tutorial campaign there are a lot of things that are added in mods that you won‚Äôt learn from the tutorial (many vanilla mechanics are changed as well). If you ask, I‚Äôll be glad to boot up a training scenario and show you the ropes of these mods.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-zeus">Understanding Zeus</h1>

<p>Most of the time we play Arma we will be playing a gamemode called Zeus. This gamemode is built around the idea of a ‚Äúgame master‚Äù who can control the scenario to create a game that is tailored specifically to the players, in a similar way to DnD. Zeus is usually present in the game but does not actually play with the players and instead usually acts as command to issue orders and give information to the players. This allows Zeus to keep a close eye and the players‚Äô activites and craft the scenario accordingly.</p>

<h1 id="arma-etiquette">Arma Etiquette</h1>

<p>We aren‚Äôt a serious group. We play to have fun and not to have to call some 14 year old ‚ÄúSir‚Äù in a video game. We play with some mil-sim rules just because it makes it more likely for dumb shit to happen but no one is going to force you to act like you‚Äôre in the military. However, there is some basic etiquette you should observe.</p>

<h2 id="dress-code">Dress code</h2>

<p>For fuck‚Äôs sake, just wear unit and time period appropriate fatigues/rigs/helmets and use appropriate weapons. You can diversify among your squadmates a bit but if you seriously want to go into an op looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/images/arma_dc.jpg" alt="arma" /></p>

<p>‚Ä¶ prepare for your ass to become a suprisingly effective lightning rod.</p>

<h2 id="dont-do-outrageously-stupid-shit-purposefully">Don‚Äôt do outrageously stupid shit (purposefully)</h2>

<p>I get it. You wanna do dumb shit. It‚Äôs funny. I know. When dumb shit happens on accident it‚Äôs hilarious. But do keep in mind that the Zeus (almost fucking always me) put effort into making the op fun and to have someone kill the whole squad at the beginning of the mission is beyond annoying. Like I said, you don‚Äôt have to act like you‚Äôre in the military but at least try to act like a human with a survival instinct, if even a very stupid human.</p>
