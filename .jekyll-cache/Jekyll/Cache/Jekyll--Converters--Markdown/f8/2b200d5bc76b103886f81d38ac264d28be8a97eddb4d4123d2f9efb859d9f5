<h1 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h1>

<p>To play TTT with us, there’s a few things you’ll need first.</p>

<h2 id="required">REQUIRED</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/guides/Radmin-VPN.html">Radmin VPN</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/">Garry’s Mod</a></li>
  <li>And either…
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/">Counter Strike: Source</a></li>
      <li>Counter Strike: Source content (will be covered later)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optional-may-improve-your-experience">OPTIONAL (may improve your experience)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/380/HalfLife_2_Episode_One/">Half-Life 2: Episode 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420/HalfLife_2_Episode_Two/">Half-Life 2: Episode 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve sorted all of that, you’ll need to subscribe to all the addons that we use. You can do so by pressing “Subscribe to All” on the <a href="steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960290210">Workshop Collection</a> (this link opens the page on Steam and your browser may ask if you want to do that). Note that this collection is updated often so you may want to Favorite it or otherwise keep it handy.</p>

<h1 id="getting-css-content">Getting CS:S content</h1>

<p>It is possible to get the required CS:S content without, well, paying for it. It isn’t very hard but it can be risky to find and download it (as in: you may very well get some malware). It’s also possible that you may not get the full experience that you would get from buying CS:S.</p>
