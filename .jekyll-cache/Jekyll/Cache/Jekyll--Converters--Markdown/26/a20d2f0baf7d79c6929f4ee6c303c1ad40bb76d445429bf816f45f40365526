I"º	<p>Note that this post assumes you are starting from scratch. If you have already played Arma before, please see the â€œUpdating Modsâ€ section.</p>

<p>Also note that this guide (like every other one that will be written on this site) assumes the reader is a fucking idiot. Donâ€™t be offended if you arenâ€™t a fucking idiot. There are several fucking idiots in this group who know less about computers than a brick wall (which is the whole reason I set this shit up in the first place; Itâ€™s a pain in the ass to have to explain to eight different people how to do one thing at eight different levels when I just want to play fucking Gmod).</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

<p>Assuming you know youâ€™ll need Arma itself, there are a few programs youâ€™ll need to play with us.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/guides/Radmin-VPN.html">Radmin VPN</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/">Teamspeak 3</a></li>
</ol>

<p>We use Teamspeak for the Task Force Radio mod which allows positional VOIP and usage of radios in-game. It is damn near essential in order to keep communications organized (having 7+ people in a voice call gets hectic quickly).</p>

<h2 id="should-i-buy-the-arma-3-dlc">â€œShould I buy the Arma 3 DLC?â€</h2>

<p>None of the Arma 3 DLC is required. If the Apex DLC is on sale you may want to buy it solely for the map but most of the content that we use (and will likely ever use) are from mods.</p>

<h1 id="learning-to-play">Learning to play</h1>

<p>Arma is a complex game. It is meant to be a simulator and thus has uncommon game mechanics and a billion keybinds. So please, for the love of all that is holy, play through the â€œBootcampâ€ campaign before you come to play with us. Itâ€™ll take you an hour or two but it will teach you the basics of movement, combat, and equipment usage. You donâ€™t have to play through the whole thing but it will really help you when you start. Donâ€™t show up to an operation not knowing how to play. Note that when you play the campaign that you should launch the game without any mods enabled (which can be done by clicking the arrow next to the â€œPlayâ€ button and pressing â€œâ€).</p>

<p>Note that even after playing through the tutorial campaign there are a lot of things that are added in mods that you wonâ€™t learn from the tutorial (many vanilla mechanics are changed as well). If you ask, Iâ€™ll be glad to boot up a training scenario and show you the ropes of these mods.</p>
