<p>Radmin VPN is a VPN service we use to host servers over a private network. It is not the same kind of VPN like you use for privacy, but is instead used for connecting specific computers to each other via a private network. Using it allows for quick and easy server setup and does not require port forwarding (which is usually not allowed on public networks).</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used Hamachi, Radmin is essentially the same thing. However, Radmin allows for no limit to the amount of people in a network, whereas Hamachi requires monthly payment to have more than 5 people in one network (and I sure as shit ain’t paying for it). Radmin also does not require an account to use.</p>

<p>You’ll need it if you want to play on servers hosted by us. Games like Gmod, Arma, or Minecraft will require you to have the VPN to access our servers.</p>

<h3 id="download-and-install">Download and install</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com/">the Radmin VPN website</a> and press the “Free Download” button. Run the installer and install the program to a desired directory. Note that when the installer says that you must restart your PC for the program to work that <strong>you must restart your PC for the program to work.</strong> Don’t ask for help until you’ve done this.</p>
