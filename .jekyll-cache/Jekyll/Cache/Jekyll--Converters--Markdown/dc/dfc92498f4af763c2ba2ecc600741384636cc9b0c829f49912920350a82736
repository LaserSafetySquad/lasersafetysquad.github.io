<h1 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h1>

<p>To play TTT with us, there‚Äôs a few things you‚Äôll need first.</p>

<h2 id="required">REQUIRED</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/guides/Radmin-VPN.html">Radmin VPN</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/">Garry‚Äôs Mod</a></li>
  <li>And either‚Ä¶
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/">Counter Strike: Source</a></li>
      <li>Counter Strike: Source content (will be covered later)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optional-may-improve-your-experience">OPTIONAL (may improve your experience)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/380/HalfLife_2_Episode_One/">Half-Life 2: Episode 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420/HalfLife_2_Episode_Two/">Half-Life 2: Episode 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you‚Äôve sorted all of that, you‚Äôll need to subscribe to all the addons that we use. You can do so by pressing ‚ÄúSubscribe to All‚Äù on the <a href="steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960290210">Workshop Collection</a> (this link opens the page on Steam and your browser may ask if you want to do that). Note that this collection is updated often so you may want to Favorite it or otherwise keep it handy.</p>

<h1 id="getting-css-content">Getting CS:S content</h1>

<p>It is possible to get the required CS:S content without, well, paying for it. It isn‚Äôt very hard but it can be risky to find and download it (as in: you may very well get some malware). It‚Äôs also possible that you may not get the full experience that you would get from buying CS:S. I would advise that you buy CS:S when it goes on sale (which it does <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/240/">pretty often</a> and for very cheap, eiether $1.99 or $0.99).</p>
