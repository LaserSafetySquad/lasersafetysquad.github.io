I"€<p>Note that this post assumes you have nothing (no Gmod, CS:S). If you have already played TTT before, please see the ‚ÄúUpgrading to TTT2‚Äù section.</p>

<p>Also note that this guide (like every other one that will be written on this site) assumes the reader is a fucking idiot. Don‚Äôt be offended if you aren‚Äôt a fucking idiot. There are several fucking idiots in this group (which is the whole reason I set this shit up in the first place. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass to have to explain to eight different people how to do one thing at eight different levels when I just want to play fucking Gmod).</p>

<h1 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h1>

<p>To play TTT with us, there‚Äôs a few things you‚Äôll need first.</p>

<h2 id="required">REQUIRED</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/guides/Radmin-VPN.html">Radmin VPN</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/">Garry‚Äôs Mod</a></li>
  <li>And either‚Ä¶
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/">Counter Strike: Source</a></li>
      <li>Counter Strike: Source content (will be covered later)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optional-may-improve-your-experience">OPTIONAL (may improve your experience)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/380/HalfLife_2_Episode_One/">Half-Life 2: Episode 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420/HalfLife_2_Episode_Two/">Half-Life 2: Episode 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As stated, the optional items aren‚Äôt <em>necessary</em> but some maps might look better with them. Ultimately, everything here is worth buying at some point but don‚Äôt sweat it if you don‚Äôt wanna pay for the optional stuff. They goes on sale often and you may want to buy them then (they‚Äôre worth playing).</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve sorted all of that, you‚Äôll need to subscribe to all the addons that we use. You can do so by pressing ‚ÄúSubscribe to All‚Äù on the <a href="steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960290210">Workshop Collection</a> (this link opens the page on Steam and your browser may ask if you want to do that). Note that this collection is updated often so you may want to Favorite it or otherwise keep it handy.</p>

<h1 id="getting-css-content">Getting CS:S content</h1>

<p>It is possible to get the required CS:S content without, well, paying for it. It isn‚Äôt very hard but it can be risky to find and download it (as in: you may get some malware depending on where you get your files from). It‚Äôs also possible that you may not get the full experience that you would get from buying CS:S. I would advise that you buy CS:S when it goes on sale (which it does <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/240/">pretty often</a> and for very cheap, eiether $1.99 or $0.99).</p>

<h1 id="joining-the-game">Joining the game</h1>

<p>As stated in the Radmin VPN guide, most of the time you should be provided with the IP or will be able to get it from Radmin. Just ask if you need this info.</p>
