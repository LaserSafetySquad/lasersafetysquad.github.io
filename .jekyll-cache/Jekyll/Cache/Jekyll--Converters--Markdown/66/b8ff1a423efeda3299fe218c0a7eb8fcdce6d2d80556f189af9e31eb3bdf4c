<p>Radmin VPN is a VPN service we use to host servers over a private network. It is not the same kind of VPN like you use for privacy, but is instead used for connecting specific computers to each other via a private network. Using it allows for quick and easy server setup and does not require port forwarding which is usually not allowed on public networks.</p>
